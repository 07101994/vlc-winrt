Changelog
* Better UX when connecting to Last.FM
* Fix Subtitles and AudioTracks bugs (Windows only, still not working on Windows Phone)
* Clean StatusBar code
* Phones with virtual Navigation Bar are now supported by VLC. Users with Lumia like 735 won't have the UI under the virtual Navigation Bar
* App should not crash anymore if a track does not exist/file is not found. It removes the track from the VLC library.
* Hide Mouse cursor and let the screen ON only when playing videos, not music
* App should start way faster. Example : On a Lumia 1020 it starts in 2 seconds instead of 7.
* App commands : Open file, stream and Settings are now displayed in a "more" button on the top of the UI.
* Adding Database versioning: this is the last version on WP that will drop the database at each update. Now it will use migration tools when the database is modified.
* Decrease app weight by removing unused files, pictures, placeholders and libraries
* Usual bugfixing and refactoring


Changes between 1.3.1 and 1.3.2
-------------------------------
Release: April 27th 2015

Changelog:
 * Add back button in Search Pages
 * Fix responsive design and UX issues in Search Pages
 * Lumia 1020/920/925 get Responsive Design fix for issue « Music Player isn’t showing all controls in landscape mode »
 * InterProcess communication between the VLC process and the Background Audio Task was using to much CPU to get Position, Time, MediaPlayerState… Now using a cache for those values, CPU consumption went from up to 40% to less than 10%. Great news.
 * Fixed FileNotFoundException when Sharing the now playing album if it has no cover.
 * If a media fails to read, sometimes the app crashed when it wants to display the « can’t read media » dialog. It should be fixed.
 * A dozen of tiny bugs/crashes are also fixed.
 
Delayed for 1.3.3:
 * Access to Open File, Open Stream, Settings even while playing music
 * Weird cross mark in TextBox on Windows Phone

Changes between 1.1.2 and 1.3.0
-------------------------------
Release: April 23th 2015

Notes:
>> Worked a lot on cleaning the code (and there's much to do left), optimizations, fixing bugs, etc...
>> 99% of our code is now shared between Windows Phone and Windows, we're basically ready for the Windows 10 SDK migration.

Changelog:
 * Updated User Interface
 * Optimisations of XAML code, which is between 50% and 130% faster (parsing and layout rendering).
 * LastFM scrobbling working on Windows
 * Browse music and videos from folders. For example if your songs are not correctly tagged, you can browse in VLC and "play a folder" just like you would play an album.
 * XAML Responsive Design enhancements : we're trying to use your screen as best as possible. On tiny screens we removed the "now playing" title which is useless, and on a big screen we give more options with extra buttons, etc.
 * Use of Windows 10 APIs via Reflection for setting a custom, orange window background color.
 * New icons, margins and alignments are more polished (even if it's still work in progress)
 * Refresh button in the Video Library, just like the Music library
 * Search videos or albums easily.
 * Updated design for Video Player (still very work in progress though)
 * Adding Semantic Zoom in the Albums view, with custom selection of ordering (by artist, by date, by album).
 * We added a back button so devices like Lumia 730 or future tiny tablets will be able to go back easily.
 * Using the same colors as VLC for Android/iOS.
Along with lots of bug fixes, etc.
 
Please don't forget:
>> This version is still far from perfect and we would like to hear your feedback. What you like and dislike, what features you want us to add, etc.
>> Windows Phone got v1.3 today however we're not releasing this update on Windows.
 
Known bugs:
 * The video player still sucks
 * Unless you play an MKV file or an uncommon video, you won't be able to choose an embedded or external subtitle, nor specify an audio track.
 * The latest Windows 10 Mobile builds are really buggy and lots of apps are crashing, so don't expect much stability over there.
